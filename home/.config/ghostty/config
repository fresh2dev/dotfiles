# Configure a preference for window decorations. This setting specifies
# a _preference_; the actual OS, desktop environment, window manager, etc.
# may override this preference. Ghostty will do its best to respect this
# preference but it may not always be possible.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
#   * `none` - All window decorations will be disabled. Titlebar,
#     borders, etc. will not be shown. On macOS, this will also disable
#     tabs (enforced by the system).
# 
#   * `auto` - Automatically decide to use either client-side or server-side
#     decorations based on the detected preferences of the current OS and
#     desktop environment. This option usually makes Ghostty look the most
#     "native" for your desktop.
# 
#   * `client` - Prefer client-side decorations.
# 
#   * `server` - Prefer server-side decorations. This is only relevant
#     on Linux with GTK, either on X11, or Wayland on a compositor that
#     supports the `org_kde_kwin_server_decoration` protocol (e.g. KDE Plasma,
#     but almost any non-GNOME desktop supports this protocol).
# 
#     If `server` is set but the environment doesn't support server-side
#     decorations, client-side decorations will be used instead.
# 
# The default value is `auto`.
# 
# For the sake of backwards compatibility and convenience, this setting also
# accepts boolean true and false values. If set to `true`, this is equivalent
# to `auto`. If set to `false`, this is equivalent to `none`.
# This is convenient for users who live primarily on systems that don't
# differentiate between client and server-side decorations (e.g. macOS and
# Windows).
# 
# The "toggle_window_decorations" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime. This will always toggle
# back to "auto" if the current value is "none" (this is an issue
# that will be fixed in the future).
# 
# Changing this configuration in your configuration and reloading will
# only affect new windows. Existing windows will not be affected.
# 
# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values. The list of actions is available in
# the documentation or using the `ghostty +list-actions` command.
# 
# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`.
# 
# Valid keys are currently only listed in the
# [Ghostty source code](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/d6e76858164d52cff460fedc61ddf2e560912d71/src/input/key.zig#L255).
# This is a documentation limitation and we will improve this in the future.
# A common gotcha is that numeric keys are written as words: e.g. `one`,
# `two`, `three`, etc. and not `1`, `2`, `3`. This will also be improved in
# the future.
# 
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
# 
# Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
# modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
# that Ghostty uses.
# 
# Some additional notes for triggers:
# 
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
# 
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
# 
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
# 
#   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a
#     physical key mapping rather than a logical one. A physical key
#     mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode
#     translated by any system keyboard layouts. Example: "ctrl+physical:a"
# 
# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
# sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
# `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
# user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
# is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
# is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
# 
# Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
# in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
# 
# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
# 
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
#     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
#     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
#     specifically output that key (e.g. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
#     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
# 
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
#     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
#     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
#     will do nothing.
# 
#   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
#     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
#     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
# 
#   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
#     triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
# 
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
# 
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
# 
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable. Unbind will remove any matching trigger,
#     including `physical:`-prefixed triggers without specifying the
#     prefix.
# 
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. e.g. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
# 
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. e.g. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
# 
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     e.g. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
# 
#   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the
#     `ghostty +list-actions` command.
# 
# Some notes for the action:
# 
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
# 
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
# 
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
# 
# The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change
# the behavior of the keybind. These are:
# 
#   * `all:` - Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
#     keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
#     then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
#     applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
#     are already global (e.g. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.
# 
#   * `global:` - Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work
#     within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused,
#     sometimes terminal focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work
#     globally across your system (e.g. even when Ghostty is not focused),
#     specify this prefix. This prefix implies `all:`. Note: this does not
#     work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more
#     information.
# 
#   * `unconsumed:` - Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind
#     will consume the input, meaning that the associated encoding (if
#     any) will not be sent to the running program in the terminal. If
#     you wish to send the encoded value to the program, specify the
#     `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire keybind. For example:
#     `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`. `global:` and `all:`-prefixed
#     keybinds will always consume the input regardless of this setting.
#     Since they are not associated with a specific terminal surface,
#     they're never encoded.
# 
#   * `performable:` - Only consume the input if the action is able to be
#     performed. For example, the `copy_to_clipboard` action will only
#     consume the input if there is a selection to copy. If there is no
#     selection, Ghostty behaves as if the keybind was not set. This has
#     no effect with `global:` or `all:`-prefixed keybinds. For key
#     sequences, this will reset the sequence if the action is not
#     performable (acting identically to not having a keybind set at
#     all).
# 
#     Performable keybinds will not appear as menu shortcuts in the
#     application menu. This is because the menu shortcuts force the
#     action to be performed regardless of the state of the terminal.
#     Performable keybinds will still work, they just won't appear as
#     a shortcut label in the menu.
# 
# Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
# `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
# set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
# `global:` keybind will be used.
# 
# Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
# `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
# and not consume the input to reload the config.
# 
# Note: `global:` is only supported on macOS. On macOS,
# this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted to Ghostty.
# When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched or reloaded,
# Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions. If the permissions are
# not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS, you can find these
# permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.
